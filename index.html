      <p>
        An alligator is a large reptile that belongs to the genus Alligator and
        the family Alligatoridae. There are two extant species of alligators:
        the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) and the Chinese
        alligator (Alligator sinensis). Alligators are semi-aquatic carnivorous
        reptiles with four small legs and a very large, long tail. The tail is
        half the animal’s total length and helps propel them rapidly through the
        water and create pools of water during dry seasons called “gator holes”.
